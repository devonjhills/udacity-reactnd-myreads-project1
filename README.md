# MyReads Project
First Project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program.

[**Click here to see a live version of this App**](https://devon-reactnd-myreads.herokuapp.com/)

## Instructions
To view project:

* clone repository, `cd` to project directory
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Project Overview
In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library. To keep the interface consistent, you may consider re-using some of the code you used to display the books on the main page.

When a book is on a bookshelf, it should have the same state on both the main application page and the search page.

The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.

When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library

## Backend Server
To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`
Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`
Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`
Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
